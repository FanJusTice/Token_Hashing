# Token Hashing 
- All tests were conducted on a Linux system (VMware Ubuntu 20.04.5-desktop).
- The test machine is equipped with an `AMD Ryzen 7 5800H` processor, an 8-core 16-thread CPU, with a 512KB L1 cache, 4.0MB L2 cache, and 16.0MB L3 cache, running at a base frequency of `3.20GHz`.
- The data used in the experiments consists of randomly generated key-value pairs, e.g., `10000000 coEflU`, generated by our 
  own program, to ensure the randomness ofdata insertion.
- The code for token hashing is run in `DRAM` platform.

# Run
1. Run `makefile` to generate an executable file `Token` : `make`
3. Run `Token` with the input parameters `level_size` `insert_data_1` `query_data_1` `insert_data_2` `query_data_2`
   - e.g., `./Token 2 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt 4.txt`
